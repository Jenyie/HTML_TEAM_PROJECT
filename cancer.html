 <p id = "paragraph2">The constellation of Cancer does not include the Cancer sign. Commencing in July, it spans the fourth 30 degrees of the circle, beginning with the summer solstice. Because Cancer is a cardinal sign, it begins a season like Aries, which denotes spring. Historically, the summer solstice constellation of Cancer was situated at or near the same latitudes as the sun's current northernmost observation point. Despite having a name derived from the Latin word for crab, the Crab is the second-largest constellation in terms of area and brightness. Since a constellation looks like an upside-down "Y," we can hardly see it with unaided vision. </p><br>
<p id = "paragraph2">It is between Gemini and Leo and has the lowest magnitude of any zodiacal constellation. The "Dark Sign," sometimes known as the "Black Sign," was the deathmark. Its dim aspect gave it the appearance of being dark and lacking eyes. Once believed to have been the site of the Mesopotamian South Sun, Cancer (the crayfish or crab) later came to be associated with the fourth month of July, Duzu, which currently falls in June-July. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">One of the most devoted, sensitive, and determined signs is Cancer. Cancers are also incredibly persuasive, and when they put their minds to anything, they typically succeed. Cancers typically exhibit a high sense of moodiness, which is another prominent personality attribute. They tend to be pessimists and often focus on the bad. Cancers can also be deceptive, especially while pursuing their goals. Most Cancer zodiac sign natives are renowned to be diligent workers. They are not frightened of a little hard effort and will do whatever is necessary to complete the task. Additionally, they are fiercely devoted to their friends and family, and they will always be there for them.
