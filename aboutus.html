  <p id = "paragraph4"> We are three Portlaoise Institute students majoring in computer science. Jennifer, Bernita, and Kiah are our names.</p>
      <br>
<p id = "paragraph4"> Jennifer, a mature student who is 29 years old, has a passion for programming. She took a quick course after falling in love with programming after witnessing her sister, a full-stack developer, write code.</p>
    
<p id = "paragraph4">Bernita, a 19-year-old student from Latvia who loves to code, is a student. She became interested in programming after watching her brother take classes at the First School of Programmers and code in HTML.</p>
<p id = "paragraph4">Kiah, a 21-year-old college student, is interested in programming because of her love of video games and hopes to one day create her own games.
  <br><br>
<p id = "paragraph4">We all met while working together on a project, and when the chance occurred, we decided to start this website to share our love of astrology. Astrology, in the words of Steven Forrest, "is merely a finger pointing at reality." We put this quote on our homepage because it spoke to us deeply. Bernita was initially sceptical, but as she got to know Jennifer and Kiah better and learned more, the more she began to believe. If you would want to stay and explore our website, we would love to share this passion with you. 
<br><br>
<p id = "paragraph4">We hope to inform you about the twelve signs of the tropical zodiac on our website. We have worked extremely hard to reference each and every individual zodiac and explain what it means and how it can apply to you. Although your sun sign only scratches the surface of what it can really tell you about yourself, being able to relate to one or two personality traits is undoubtedly exciting; it's almost like writing your own personal profile as you learn more and more about who you are. The 12 zodiac signs and their associated historical symbolism are provided on the website, and we have detailed what compatibility exists for each of the twelve signs depending on their element. This is important in some relationships since, of the four, we've discussed why each is unique and what enhances and detracts from the others.

  <br>
<p id = "paragraph4">As a team of three we developed all the fundamentals the site needs to guide you through each and every zodiac listed for you. The collaborative efforts have produced a mini encyclopaedia for you to loom around as much as you desire, we have nothing but the best intent on developing this website as we’ve declared before, each and every one of us stemmed from a different route into coding and we have shared the love for spirituality through astrology into this intertwined development that we have created together. Bernita being a sceptic could resonate with some of the viewers of this website not really understanding the inner workings of astrology and what resonates and what doesn’t.</p>
      <br>
<p id = "paragraph4">Our website is more so geared for beginners into the astrological universe, and that is to set you on a path of discovering more than just your sun sign/birth sign which is the sign you’re probably the most familiar with based on your date of birth. Throughout the website we’ve maintained a simplification and minimalistic but intriguing design that permits the viewer (you!) an easygoing and comprehensive experience when educating yourself. As prior mentioned, if you are perplexed about anything that isn’t technical feel free to contact us on the provided information and we can help you with resources to further strengthen your level of understanding everything that the zodiac signs have to offer you, which can range to in depth compatibility, birth charts and other incredible revelations. Please get in touch with us using the information provided on this page if you have any inquiries or technical problems.
