  <h1 id="headh1"><span class="notbold">Capricorn</span></h1>
  <h2 id="headh2">December 22nd - January 19th</h2>

  <p id = "paragraph2">The tenth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn, is linked to the Capricornus constellation. On or about December 21st, the sun enters Capricorn, and it leaves on or about January 20th. With Taurus and Virgo, Capricorn is an Earth sign and has a high level of love compatibility. The Earth sign team is realistic, driven, stoic, and independent. They would be a wonderful ally, but never at a gathering.  

<p id = "paragraph2">The hardest workers in the zodiac, Capricorns love nothing more than to outperform their contemporaries. They are tenacious, driven, powerful, and experienced. When others might have given up after ten miles, they will continue. Because of this, they make great friends, partners in life, and colleagues. While keeping their social circles modest, Capricorns are devoted to and supportive of their friends and partners. They like building comfortable, enjoyable, and opulent lives that others enviously desire. Their health is important to them. Capricorns are born smart, conscious of their own wants and abilities, and perceptive of what makes other people tick. The Capitals are lovely people. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">No other zodiac sign's personality can keep up with a to-do list like a Capricorn's since they are dependable, orderly, and diligent. These Earth signs are exceptionally good at establishing goals, being practical, and providing the foundation for their ideas. Although Capricorns are characterized as workaholics, a closer examination of their traits reveals that they are much more adaptable. They are one of the most powerful zodiac signs, giving them the capacity to carry out carefully thought-out future strategies. Although Capricorns are committed to their profession, they also enjoy having fun, letting loose, and taking care of themselves. They work long hours, yet they also are available to have fun. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">The primary issue with Capricorns is that they tend to get cranky and demanding. They also have a bad temper, are irritable, and harbor grudges. They struggle with change, especially when it is something they have grown accustomed to. Additionally, this sign cannot effectively be conveyed in certain situations. They hold a widely divergent opinion, which explains why they are prone to mood swings. A Capricorn may hide an overpowering workaholic who can be overly stern and failure-fearing under their appealing exterior. If they have decided, you will want to get out of their way. Although Capricorns are brilliant strategists, they may also be greedy, power-hungry, or unduly authoritarian.
