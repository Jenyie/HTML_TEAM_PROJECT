   <p id = "paragraph2">The Leo constellation in the sky does not match the Leo zodiac sign. It occupies a 30-degree segment of the zodiac circle between Cancer and Virgo. The fifth sign, Leo, is a fixed sign that comes right after Cancer signs as they start their summer. It is associated with a scorching, brilliant summer. Regulus, the keeper of the North, is one of the Royal Stars found in this constellation. Given that the Big Dipper points to this cluster, which resembles a lion, it is easy to locate Leo in the night sky. </p><br>

 

<p id = "paragraph2">Leos have a yang, active, or male disposition and engage with the outside world actively. People born under the morning star, sunrise, or moon sign of the sun-god possess a fiery core personality like to Summer's solar force at its core. As a fixed sign, the lion is linked to attributes of endurance, which makes Leos in their charts outstanding project supporters as well as motivating team leaders. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">These sun-ruled people can be compared to "performers" in the zodiac who fearlessly put themselves in the middle of every situation. Leos are born leaders who enjoy taking risks and have the highest levels of confidence of any other sign.People that are naturally happy, passionate, and upbeat seem to have an easier time of it. People with strong, well-supported Leo chart positions rarely doubt themselves and can typically rely on a durable foundation of self-assurance when they embark on their life's journeys and pursuits. They love life's pleasures as much as material wealth and are kind to others. They are considerate and grateful for wonderful experiences and gifts. Because they can symbolize anything, this sign is naturally suited to act as the face or representative of a concept, a collective ideology, initiative, or movement. Their leadership style will be inspirational rather than administrative, keeping everyone focused on a message and purpose through their compelling presence. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">This sign's inherent capacity to represent anything makes them an ideal figurehead or representative of an idea, a group philosophy, project, or movement. Instead of always being administrative, their leadership style will be inspirational, keeping everyone focused on a message and purpose through their compelling presence.
