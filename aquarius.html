  <!-- Information on aquarius -->
  <p id = "paragraph2"> The constellation of Gemini does not match the sign of Aquarius. It occupies the 11th 30 degrees of the zodiac circle, halfway between Capricorn and Pisces. After the start of Capricorn's winter season, the fixed sign of Aquarius enters the zodiac. It represents the cold, snowy, and hard second half of winter before any signs of spring appear. Antares, commonly known as the Heart of the Scorpion or the brightest star in the constellation, derives its name from Greek mythology. The phrase's final portion relates to a Latin phrase that means "water-carrier" or "cup-carrier," one of the zodiac's oldest and most well-known constellations. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">The most charitable zodiac sign is Aquarius. 

They are personable, quick witted, and always ready with a joke. Additionally, they have a keen sense of fairness. 

Great friends, Aquarians are there for you whenever you need them. 

Because of their independence, Aquarians are well known. They enjoy doing things their way and are highly independent. 

 They are friendly, witty, and always have a joke ready. They also have a powerful sense of justice. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">Aquarians make great friends and are always there for you. 

 The independence of the Aquarians is well known. They are quite autonomous and like to do things their way. 

The Aquarius zodiac sign is characterized by high intelligence and mental agility. 

 They excel at interpersonal communication as well. They are extremely humanitarian and always willing to lend a hand. 

 Their independence and capacity for situational flexibility are further assets. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">Aquarians have a reputation for being extremely rigid and hot-tempered. They may also act without thinking because they can be very impulsive. 

 Their dislike of solitude and need for independence are among their flaws. 

It is the final of the four fixed zodiac signs, all of which are regarded as constant. Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio are the other three fixed signs. 

The moon, various planetary cross-connections, and the rising sign with the sun sign must all be considered when determining the overall compatibility between astrological signs. </p><br>

<p id = "paragraph2">Aquarius gets along best with Gemini and Libra, other air signs. These three signs share many traits, such as a love of learning and the capacity to see both sides of any argument. </p> <br>
