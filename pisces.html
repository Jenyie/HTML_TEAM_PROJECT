Pisces is the 12th sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about February 19 to about March 20. Pisces' representation is of two separate fish that are strung together is related to the Greek mythology tale of the Goddess of beauty Aphrodite and Eros the God of love, who jumped within a river to evade the monster Typhon, and the two fish managed to take them to safety. Pisces are frequently creative, insightful, and emotional ancient souls. They are naturally drawn to deeply romantic, artistic, or transformative events and have a connection to the mystical and spiritual realm. </p><br>
<p id = "paragraph2">They frequently prioritise the needs of others over their own and are exceptionally sensitive and sympathetic. They get along well and have a vibrant social life with lots of interesting individuals. They are very sensitive and have the ability to tune into energy that most people ignore. They may, however, end up feeling overwhelmed or impressionable due to the volume of information they occasionally receive. Once this has happened, Pisceans often manage to liberate themselves and move on to new adventures, never again hesitant to reinvent themselves.</p>
